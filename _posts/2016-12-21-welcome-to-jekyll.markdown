This is the first post on the blog, I create this page inspired by multiples blogs I have seen on the web, where good computer scientists and enthusiasts write tutorials and great posts about machine learning, deep learning, trends, NLP and averything that comprises A.I.

I am sure I will not be capable of writing so well as them(the others blogs I've seen arround here), but this is more kind of a personal project to train my english and try to get the feeling behind explaining things to others.
This is a chance of expanding my own knowledge at the same time I share it with others. 
This sentiment comes from the will to democratize the machine learning and A.I, Retribute a bit of knowledge I could adquire with the information, I found around there.
