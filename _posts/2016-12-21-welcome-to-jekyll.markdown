This is the first post on the blog, I create this page inspired by multiples blogs I have seen on the web, where good computer scientists and enthusiasts write tutorials and great posts about machine learning, deep learning, trends, NLP and averything that comprises A.I.

I am sure I will not be capable of writing so well as them (the others blogs I've seen arround there), but this is more kind of a personal project to train my english and try to get the feeling behind explaining things to others.
This is a chance of expanding my own knowledge at the same time I share it with others, of course if the time and schedule allow me. 

This sentiment of sharing comes from the will to democratize the machine learning and A.I, retribute a bit of the knowledge I could adquire with the information, I found around there.

### *I hope people in the field each time spread their knowledge more, In that way, we will be each time nearer of the Holy Grail of A.I*
